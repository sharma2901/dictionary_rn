You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile App Development.

Code Style and Structure:

- Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
- Use functional components and hooks over class components.
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.
- Use Nativewind for styling.
- Plan well before writing code.
- List all the packages which need to be installed.
- Clearly mention if newly installed packages needs to be linked and steps to perform that.
- Give step by step clear instructions for the changes to be made.
- Use Nativewind docs to learn more about it (https://www.nativewind.dev/).

Naming Conventions:

- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
- Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).

TypeScript Usage:

- Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
- Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
- Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props.

Performance Optimization:

- Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
- Use `React.memo()` for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Optimize FlatLists with props like `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch`, and `windowSize`.
- Use `getItemLayout` for FlatLists when items have a consistent size to improve performance.
- Avoid anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent re-renders.

UI and Styling:

- Use consistent styling, either through `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components.
- Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
- Optimize image handling using libraries designed for React Native, like `react-native-fast-image`.

Best Practices:

- Follow React Native's threading model to ensure smooth UI performance.
- Utilize Expo's local build and updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
- Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking with best practices.
- Implement error handling and logging for debugging and user feedback.
- Use `expo-font` for loading custom fonts.
- Consider using `expo-blur` for blur effects on Android.
- Utilize `expo-haptics` for haptic feedback on iOS.
- Use `expo-constants` for accessing device information.
- Implement `expo-linking` for deep linking and app navigation.
